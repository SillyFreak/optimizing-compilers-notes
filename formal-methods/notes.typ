  = About this document

  This document is based on the Formal Methods in Informatics lecture at Vienna University of Technology; particularly from taking it in the 2023/24 winter term. Corrections and additions are welcome as pull requests at

  This document leaves out several details and was written primarily for me, but I hope it is useful for other people as well.

  If you have questions, feel free to reach out on Github. I may at least occasionally be motivated enough to answer questions, extend the document with explanations based on your question, or help you with adding it yourself.
